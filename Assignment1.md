# Assessment of Competency in Data Analytics

## Introduction

As I approach the capstone course for my Master's degree in Computer Information Systems, I am reflecting on my preparedness across the key curricular areas, starting with Data Analytics. With over 30 years in IT and more than 15 years focused on systems design and development in the industrial construction industry, this area has allowed me to synthesize my extensive professional background with academic learning. Through courses like CIDM5310 (Business Intelligence & Decision Support Systems) and CIDM6312 (Seminar in Information Visualization), I have built a solid understanding of tools and concepts for analyzing and presenting data effectively, drawing on my cumulative experiences in real-world systems to enhance classroom applications. In this assessment, I will outline my strongest competencies, areas of weakness, and gaps in knowledge. I will support this with examples from my coursework, sources I consulted, a summary of my capabilities, and my readiness to apply this in my portfolio and prototype project. Finally, I will discuss how Data Analytics integrates with other program areas—Data Management, Software Systems, and Networking and Cybersecurity—to form a cohesive foundation for my capstone.

## What I Know: Strongest Competencies, Skills, and Knowledge

In Data Analytics, I feel most confident in my ability to define problems, locate relevant data, and use tools like Python and PowerBI to analyze and visualize information, informed by my long tenure in IT and systems development. From CIDM5310, I excelled in problem definition and finding data, which involves scoping business questions and sourcing datasets from APIs, databases, or public repositories—skills honed through years of designing industrial construction systems where data-driven decisions optimized project efficiencies. This expertise is crucial for real-world applications, such as identifying key performance indicators in a business intelligence dashboard.

Python has become one of my strongest tools; I am proficient in using it for data manipulation, scripting automated workflows, and integrating with Jupyter Notebooks or Google Colab for exploratory analysis. For instance, in CIDM5310, I built scripts to clean and process datasets, applying libraries like Pandas for data frames and Matplotlib for basic visualizations. Software architecture is another area of strength, where I can design scalable systems for data pipelines, ensuring modularity and efficiency, leveraging my 15+ years in systems design to create robust architectures tailored to industrial needs.

In CIDM6312, my proficiency shone in PowerBI and storytelling with data. I can create interactive dashboards that convey complex insights through intuitive visuals, incorporating best practices in good design—such as color theory, layout balance, and user-centric storytelling. I am adept at transforming raw data into narratives that drive decisions, like using DAX formulas in PowerBI to calculate metrics and hierarchies. Overall, these skills make me confident in handling end-to-end analytics projects, from data ingestion to presentation, amplified by my professional background in applying similar principles to construction project management.

## Where I Am Weak: Least Confident Competencies, Skills, and Knowledge

Despite my strengths and extensive IT experience, I recognize weaknesses that could limit my effectiveness in advanced scenarios. In CIDM5310, Azure AI & ML stands out as my weakest area. While I understand basic concepts like machine learning models and cloud-based deployment, I struggle with implementing sophisticated algorithms, such as neural networks or hyperparameter tuning in Azure ML Studio. My exposure was limited to introductory labs, and I often relied on pre-built templates rather than building from scratch, even though my systems development background provides a foundation for understanding integration.

From CIDM6312, the psychology of data visualization is another weak spot. I grasp surface-level ideas, like cognitive load and perception biases, but I lack depth in applying psychological principles to optimize visuals for diverse audiences. For example, I sometimes overlook how cultural differences or accessibility needs (e.g., color blindness) affect design choices. Additionally, while I have used Tableau in the course, my familiarity is superficial compared to PowerBI; I can create basic charts but falter with advanced features like geospatial mapping or custom scripts.

These weaknesses stem from time constraints in the courses and my preference for hands-on tools over theoretical underpinnings, though my industrial experience has taught me the value of practical application. Addressing them will require targeted practice to build confidence.

## What I Wish I Knew and/or Don't Realize I Am Missing

Reflecting deeper, I wish I had more knowledge in advanced statistical methods for analytics, such as Bayesian inference or time-series forecasting, which were only briefly touched upon in my courses but could enhance my industrial systems work. I realize now that I might be missing expertise in big data technologies like Hadoop or Spark, which could handle larger-scale analytics beyond what Python and PowerBI support, especially in data-intensive construction environments. Ethical considerations in data analytics—such as bias detection in AI models or privacy regulations like GDPR—are areas I don't fully appreciate yet; I wish I had explored case studies on real-world failures, like algorithmic discrimination, to better align with my professional ethics.

Additionally, integration with emerging tools like natural language processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis in datasets is a gap. I don't realize how much I'm missing in collaborative analytics environments, such as using Git for version control in team-based data projects or integrating analytics with DevOps pipelines—areas that could bridge my IT background with modern practices. These blind spots highlight opportunities for growth as I prepare for professional roles.
