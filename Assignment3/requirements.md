# MMS Evolution 1 Requirements Specification

The Materials Management System (MMS) is a Django REST Framework (DRF) application designed to streamline material demand and tracking in industrial manufacturing. It integrates daily material requirements from Engineering and installation requirements from Fabrication, enabling a feedback loop between Procurement and Engineering to finalize specifications. MMS tracks materials from dock arrival through receiving, quality inspection, storage, preventative maintenance, requisition, inventory, widget fabrication, shipping, and customer delivery. Key personas include Engineer, Fabrication, Procurement, Sales, Warehouse, Inventory, Shipping, Inspection, Preventative Maintenance, and Quality Control. Built with Django ORM, SQLite (`mms.db`), Celery with Redis in Docker for asynchronous tasks, and a Django admin UI at `http://localhost:8000/admin/`, MMS supports CRUD endpoints (`/api/materials/`, `/api/requirements/`) and beyond-CRUD operations (demand reports, notifications, progress tracking). UML diagrams (PNG files) are stored in the `artifacts` folder at the project root. Evolution 1 diagrams are suffixed with `_r1` to distinguish from Evolution 0 diagrams, which remain available in `Evolution_0/requirements.md`.

## Problem Specification

Industrial manufacturing requires precise coordination of material demand across Engineering, Procurement, and Fabrication, with materials tracked through complex processes including inspection, storage, maintenance, and shipping. Disparate systems lead to fragmented data, manual reconciliations, and delays, resulting in errors, inefficiencies, and missed delivery deadlines. MMS addresses these challenges by aggregating data feeds from Engineering, Procurement, and Fabrication systems, providing real-time tracking of materials and widgets, and delivering analytics for demand alignment, inventory accuracy, and delivery timelines. This reduces operational risks, minimizes costs, and ensures timely customer fulfillment.

## Solution Organization

MMS leverages Django REST Framework for a scalable API, Django ORM for robust data management, and Celery with Redis in Docker for asynchronous task processing. The solution is structured as follows:

- **CRUD Operations**: Manage entities (`Material`, `Requirement`, `Widget`, etc.) via RESTful endpoints (e.g., `/api/materials/`, `/api/requirements/`), using DRF viewsets and serializers.
- **Beyond-CRUD Operations**: Generate material demand reports, send notifications, and calculate order progress, with Celery handling asynchronous tasks for scalability.
- **Admin UI**: Provide a user-friendly interface at `http://localhost:8000/admin/` for data management across all personas.
- **Analytics**: Deliver dashboards and reports for material status, demand forecasting, and delivery tracking, powered by Django ORM queries and Celery tasks.

## Use Cases

Use Cases detail system interactions, incorporating Django-specific steps, edge cases, and Celery tasks for asynchronous processing.

### Use Case 1: Submit and Revise Material Requirements

- **Actors**: Engineer, Procurement
- **Precondition**: Engineer and Procurement are authenticated via DRF token authentication.
- **Description**: Engineer submits material requirements through the MMS API, triggering a Celery task for Procurement notification. Procurement reviews and provides feedback, which MMS processes and notifies Engineer. Engineer revises and finalizes specifications, stored as a `Requirement` model instance.
- **Steps**:
  1. Engineer submits a POST request to `/api/requirements/` with JSON payload `{ "material_type": "steel", "quantity": 100, "delivery_date": "2025-06-01" }`.
  2. DRF validates the payload using `RequirementSerializer`, creates a `Requirement` instance (status: "Draft"), and queues a Celery task (`notify_procurement_task`) to alert Procurement.
  3. Procurement retrieves the requirement via `GET /api/requirements/{req_id}/` and submits feedback via `POST /api/requirements/{req_id}/feedback/` with JSON `{ "availability": "limited", "lead_time": "2 weeks" }`.
  4. MMS updates the `Requirement` status to "Feedback" and queues a Celery task (`notify_engineer_task`) to alert Engineer.
  5. Engineer revises specifications via `PUT /api/requirements/{req_id}/` with updated JSON `{ "quantity": 80, "delivery_date": "2025-06-15" }`.
  6. DRF validates using `RequirementSerializer`, updates the `Requirement` to status "Finalized", and queues a Celery task (`notify_fabrication_task`) to alert Fabrication.
- **Postcondition**: Finalized `Requirement` is stored in `mms.db`, accessible to Fabrication via `GET /api/requirements/`.
- **Exceptions**:
  - If feedback is delayed beyond 24 hours, MMS triggers a Celery task (`escalate_delay_task`) to send an escalation email to Engineer.
  - If the payload is invalid (e.g., negative quantity), DRF returns a 400 Bad Request error with validation details.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Multiple feedback iterations: MMS allows up to three revisions, then escalates to a manager via a Celery task.
  - Unauthorized access: DRF returns a 401 Unauthorized error for non-authenticated users.
  - Network failure during notification: Celery retries the task up to three times.

### Use Case 2: Process Material Arrival and Inspection

- **Actors**: Warehouse, Inspection
- **Precondition**: Material shipment arrives at the dock; Warehouse and Inspection officers are authenticated via DRF.
- **Description**: Warehouse logs material arrival through the API, triggering an inspection task via Celery. The Inspection officer logs results, updating the `Material` model status, with notifications handled by Celery tasks.
- **Steps**:
  1. Warehouse worker submits a POST request to `/api/materials/arrival/` with JSON `{ "shipment_id": "S123", "material_type": "steel", "quantity": 100 }`.
  2. DRF validates using `MaterialSerializer`, creates a `Material` instance with status "Received", and queues a Celery task (`assign_inspection_task`) to notify Inspection.
  3. Inspection officer retrieves tasks via `GET /api/inspections/` and submits results via `POST /api/inspections/` with JSON `{ "material_id": "M123", "result": "Pass", "defects": null }`.
  4. MMS creates an `Inspection` instance; if passed, updates `Material` status to "Stored" and notifies Warehouse via a Celery task (`notify_warehouse_task`); if failed, updates to "Flagged" and notifies Procurement.
  5. Warehouse submits a POST request to `/api/materials/{material_id}/store/` with JSON `{ "location": "Aisle 5" }` to update the `InventoryRecord`.
- **Postcondition**: `Material` is stored or flagged in `mms.db`, with an updated `InventoryRecord` if stored.
- **Exceptions**:
  - If inspection fails, MMS halts storage and notifies Procurement via a Celery task (`notify_procurement_task`).
  - If arrival data is incomplete (e.g., missing `shipment_id`), DRF returns a 400 Bad Request error.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Partial shipment: MMS logs partial quantities and flags for Procurement review via a Celery task.
  - Inspection delay (>12 hours): MMS escalates to Inspection manager via a Celery task.
  - Duplicate shipment ID: MMS returns a 409 Conflict error.

### Use Case 3: Fabricate Widgets and Ship to Customer

- **Actors**: Fabrication, Quality Control, Shipping, Sales
- **Precondition**: Finalized material specifications are stored in MMS; materials are in storage; actors are authenticated.
- **Description**: Fabrication requisitions materials, fabricates widgets, Quality Control verifies quality, and Shipping delivers to the customer, with Sales logging receipt. All interactions occur via API endpoints, with Celery tasks for notifications and model updates.
- **Steps**:
  1. Fabrication submits a POST request to `/api/installation_requirements/` with JSON `{ "material_id": "M123", "quantity": 50, "fab_date": "2025-06-15" }` and a POST to `/api/materials/issue/` with `{ "material_id": "M123", "quantity": 50 }`.
  2. DRF validates using `MaterialSerializer`, updates `Material` status to "Issued", and queues a Celery task (`notify_warehouse_task`) to alert Warehouse.
  3. Fabrication fabricates widgets and submits a POST request to `/api/widgets/` with JSON `{ "material_id": "M123", "status": "Fabricated" }`.
  4. Quality Control submits a POST request to `/api/inspections/` with JSON `{ "widget_id": "W123", "result": "Pass" }`.
  5. MMS creates an `Inspection` instance; if passed, updates `Widget` status to "Ready for Shipping" and notifies Shipping via a Celery task (`notify_shipping_task`).
  6. Shipping submits a POST request to `/api/shipments/` with JSON `{ "widget_id": "W123", "tracking_id": "T123", "customer_id": "C456" }`, updating `Shipment` status to "Shipped".
  7. Sales submits a POST request to `/api/orders/confirm/` with JSON `{ "order_id": "O123", "received": true }`, updating `CustomerOrder` status to "Received".
- **Postcondition**: `Widget` is delivered, and receipt is recorded in `mms.db` as a `CustomerOrder`.
- **Exceptions**:
  - If quality check fails, MMS notifies Fabrication for rework via a Celery task (`notify_fabrication_task`).
  - If shipping is delayed (>24 hours), MMS escalates to Sales via a Celery task (`escalate_shipping_task`).
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Partial widget batch: MMS allows partial shipping, logging a note in the `Shipment` record.
  - Customer rejection: MMS reverts `CustomerOrder` status to "Shipped" and notifies Sales via a Celery task.
  - Insufficient material quantity: MMS returns a 400 Bad Request error during requisition.

## System Overview

The MMS integrates data from disparate systems (Engineering, Procurement, Fabrication, etc.) without replacing their Systems of Record. It uses a low-code/no-code platform for data feeds, ETL transformations, and analytics. Built with DRF, Django ORM, and SQLite (`mms.db`), it supports CRUD endpoints (`/api/materials/`, `/api/requirements/`) and beyond-CRUD operations (reports, notifications, progress tracking). Celery with Redis in Docker handles asynchronous tasks, such as notifications and report generation, ensuring scalability. Unit tests will validate functionality in future evolutions. The Django admin UI at `http://localhost:8000/admin/` provides a user-friendly interface for all personas.

## Next Steps

- **Evolution 2**: Design the DRF API and ERD for MMS entities (`Material`, `Requirement`, `Widget`, etc.).
- **Evolution 4**: Implement Django models, views, and URLs in `mms/apps/`.
- **Evolution 5**: Develop a Ubiquitous Language Glossary, Gherkin Notation for the three Use Cases, and Django unittests to validate system functionality.
