# Proficiency Review in Networking and Cybersecurity

## Foreword

As part of the CIDM6395 Capstone requirements in my Master's in Computer Information Systems, I'm putting together a clear self-assessment of my skills in the program's main areas, wrapping up with Networking and Cybersecurity. This draws on my 30-year IT career, including over 15 years in systems design and development for industrial construction, where I've handled major security challenges—like leading the recovery from a global ransomware attack. We reimaged more than 4,000 endpoints, rebuilt over 2,500 servers, got basic operations back in seven business days, and fully recovered in 21. My work in CIDM6340 (Network Management and Information Security) is building on that, and with my current enrollment in CIDM6341 (Cybersecurity Planning and Risk Management), I'm adding fresh insights right now. I've tied in real construction crisis examples to make the coursework more relevant. This review covers my strongest skills, areas where I need more work, and what I'd like to learn next. I'll back it up with examples from my work, resources I've used, a quick summary of my abilities, and how this fits into the capstone. Finally, I'll explain how Networking and Cybersecurity connects with Data Analytics, Data Management, and Software Systems to pull everything together for the capstone.

## Strongest Skills: Where I'm Most Confident

In Networking and Cybersecurity, I'm solid with tools like Wireshark for checking network traffic, TCP/IP basics for getting connections right, and full security checks, all boosted by my years in the field and my old CISSP certification (which I let lapse). In CIDM6340, I've gotten good at using Wireshark to spot issues and TCP/IP to fix network problems—stuff I've used to lock down construction site networks. I also handle information management well, keeping data safe as it moves around.

Now in CIDM6341, I'm building confidence in core cybersecurity steps, spotting phishing attempts, and setting up security plans, especially protecting key information. The risk setups I'm working on now pull straight from my ransomware experience, focusing on quick fixes and keeping things running. Overall, this gives me the tools to build networks that hold up under real pressure, based on what I've done in big recovery jobs.

## Areas Needing Work: Where I'm Less Confident

With my background, I'm strong overall, but some specific tools show where I could use more practice, especially as CIDM6341 is still going. In CIDM6340, Nessus and WinPCAP are tougher for me—I can run basic scans, but customizing scripts or digging deep into packet details isn't smooth yet. I lean on my general network know-how, but finishing the course will help tighten that up.

In CIDM6341 so far, I'm okay with standard phishing checks and basic risk planning, but I'm not as sharp on using AI for threat alerts or rolling out zero-trust setups across a big system. That's partly because the class is ongoing and I tend to stick to what I know works from experience, but my ransomware work shows I need to adapt faster. I'll hit some extra labs to build that up as the semester moves along.

## What I'd Like to Learn: Gaps I'm Seeing

Thinking ahead, I'd like to get better with forensics tools like Volatility for digging into breaches—it's touched on lightly but key for handling incidents in connected construction setups. As CIDM6341 goes on, I'm spotting holes in things like quantum-safe encryption for IoT devices and using blockchain for secure supply chains. Looking at how ransomware changes over time would help me stay one step ahead.

I also see room to improve on securing hybrid cloud setups, like with Azure Defender, to update my older systems. I'm not using user behavior analytics for spotting insider risks or SIEM tools for better alerts as much as I should—these could take my IT experience and make it more automated. With the class in progress, this is a good time to plan how to fill those gaps for the capstone and my next steps.

## Supporting Details

### Work Examples

My GitHub has early examples of my Networking and Cybersecurity work. For CIDM6340, check out [https://github.com/jim-kinter/CIDM6340](https://github.com/jim-kinter/CIDM6340). It includes Wireshark logs for TCP/IP analysis, basic Nessus scan results, and ShieldsUp checks for open ports, all based on mock industrial networks.

For CIDM6341, which is ongoing, see [https://github.com/jim-kinter/CIDM6341](https://github.com/jim-kinter/CIDM6341). There are draft phishing training materials, early security plans, and info protection outlines, tied to strategies from my ransomware recovery.

### Resources I've Used

I built these skills on my 30 years in IT and 15+ in construction systems, which helps ground the theory in real fixes. Dr. Humpherys' teaching in both courses keeps it practical, and I've added Datacamp courses on security and networking, using Google Colab for hands-on drills.

The Wireshark user guide and "TCP/IP Illustrated" by W. Richard Stevens helped with protocols. Good books include the "Hacking Exposed" series for vulnerabilities and "CISSP All-in-One Exam Guide" by Shon Harris, which refreshes my cert knowledge. For planning, I've used NIST SP 800-53 standards and KnowBe4 tools for phishing, and I'm doing more practice sessions to address weak spots as CIDM6341 continues.

## Summary of My Skills and How I'll Use Them Going Forward

Bottom line, my Networking and Cybersecurity strengths are in Wireshark and TCP/IP handling, basic risk planning, and protection steps, mixed with hands-on recovery from my industrial IT days. This sets me up to create strong setups that beat back serious threats. As CIDM6341 wraps up, I can use this to help construction companies build networks that don't go down, drawing on my quick-recovery track record for consulting gigs. Keeping at it will turn me into a go-to expert who blends solid ethics with new tech to keep data safe.

## How This Fits into the Capstone

Even with CIDM6341 still in session, I'm ready to bring Networking and Cybersecurity into the capstone. My GitHub files, explained with real-world stories, will make a strong portfolio with scans and plans. For the prototype, I picture a security layer around an industrial data flow, showing how I can tie things together.

## How This Connects to the Capstone

### Why It Works with the Other Areas

Networking and Cybersecurity fits right in by providing safe paths for pulling insights (Data Analytics), moving data (Data Management), and running apps (Software Systems). Without good security, everything's at risk, just like in my ransomware situation.

### How It Connects with the Other Areas

It links up by securing data views with Wireshark from Data Analytics (CIDM5310), protecting storage moves in Snowflake from Data Management (CIDM6351), and strengthening APIs in Software Systems (CIDM6330). For example: A secure network wrapping data processing and reports, similar to how I rebuilt our servers.

### How It Ties to My Past Work

App building from CIDM6330 makes secure software better, and database work (CIDM6350) needs strong protection. This builds on my GitHub stuff and construction background, combining security with tools for smarter maintenance.

### Statement on How It All Fits Together

Putting it all together, I see: "Strong businesses run when Networking and Cybersecurity locks down the lines, supported by organized data, flexible software, and smart analysis, creating tough setups that keep going—shown in a capstone project for secure industrial data systems." This approach will shape my portfolio, the integrated project, and the presentation, based on what I've learned from years in the trenches.
